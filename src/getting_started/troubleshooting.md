# Troubleshooting

This section addresses common problems that can arise when using The Machinery. 


## Windows 10 Editor

When it comes to crashes on Windows which you cannot debug yourself. You can enable a full crash dumb via the following file `utils/enable-full-dumps.reg`. The dumps can be found in the folder `AppData\Local\The Machinery` and then in the  `CrashDumps` folder. In case of a error report it can be very helpful to provide access to the crash dump. You can submit bugs on our public [GitHub issues page](https://github.com/OurMachinery/themachinery-public/issues). Please do not forget to mention your current Engine version.

In order to obtain log files you have to go to the same folder where you can find the CrashDumps (`**AppData\Local**``\The Machinery`) just this time you can find them in the `Logs` folder.


## tmbuild cannot find build tools

In case of a none typical installation of Visual Studios you have to provide to tmbuild the correct environment variables: `TM_VS2017_DIR` or `TM_VS2019_DIR`. They need to point to the root directory of your Visual Studio installation.


## Graphics

In case of a crash you will get an error message, this will give some information about the details of the crash. The first step in a Vulkan related crash is to update your graphics drivers. If this didn’t help then please report the issue to us with the following information.

- The error message you got when the crash happened, this should include file information and a Vulkan error code, it’s vital to share these.
