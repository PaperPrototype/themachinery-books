# The Editor

After opening the Engine, you should see the Editor's interface with menus along the top of the interface, and the basic tabs opened. The following image will show you the default engine layout.
Here's a brief description of what you can see:

1. The **Main Menu**: It allows you to navigate through the Engine, such as opening new tabs or import assets
2. The **Entity Tree** shows a tree view of the entity you are editing. It shows the entity's components and child entities. You start editing an entity by double-clicking it in the asset browser. 
3. The **Scene** shows an editable graphic view of the edited entity. You can manipulate components and child entities by selecting them. Use the *Move*, *Rotate*, and *Scale* gizmos for your desired action.
4. The **Simulate current scene** button will open the **Simulate** tab that lets you "run" or "simulate" a scene.
5. The **Properties** tab shows the properties of the currently selected object in the Scene. You can modify the properties by editing them in the properties window.
6. The **Console** tab shows diagnostic messages from the application.
7. The **Asset Browser** shows all the assets in the project and enables you to manage them.
8. The **Preview** shows a preview of the currently selected asset in the asset browser.

The Editor is a collection of editing *Tabs*, each with its specific purpose. You can drag tabs around to rearrange them. When you drag them out of the window, a new window opens. Use the *View* menu to open new tabs.

Note that you can have multiple tabs of the same type. For example, you can open various *Asset Browser* tabs to drag assets between them easily. Tabs docked in the same window work together. Therefore if you dock a *Preview* tab in the same window as an *Asset Browser*, it will show a preview of the selected asset in that browser. You can create multiple windows to view numerous assets simultaneously:

**Editor layouts**

You can rearrange the Editor layouts by dragging tabs around in the Editor. The best structure for the Editor depends on what you are doing and your personal preferences. You can save layouts via the Window Menu. It is also possible to restore your layout to the default one or load a custom-defined one in this menu.
