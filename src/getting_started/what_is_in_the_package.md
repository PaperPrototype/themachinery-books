The `All Sample Projects` download contains all these projects, and also some sample engine plugins
that can get you started with extending the engine.

Note that some of the content in these projects was created by other people and licensed under
Creative Common or other licenses. See the `*-license.txt` files in the projects for attribution and
license information.

The editor that is included allows you to:

- Import various types of DCC assets (FBX, GLTF, etc).
- Create simple entities/scenes by placing and arranging assets.
- Add scripted behaviors to entities using the visual scripting language in the *Entity Graphs*.
- Add physics collision to objects and modify their physical properties.
- Import animations and create advanced animation setups as an *Animation State Machine*.
- Import WAV files and play them or place them on entities.
- Run and simulate these behaviors using the *Simulate* tab.
- Extend the engine and the editor with your own plugins that implement new editor tabs, entity components, gameplay code, etc.
- Write your own applications, using *The Machinery* as an SDK.
