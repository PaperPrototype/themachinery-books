# Gameplay Coding in The Machinery

In this section, you will learn everything about Gameplay Coding in *The Machinery.* There are two primary ways of creating a vivid and active world:

- Using our C APIs [API Documentation](https://ourmachinery.com/apidoc/apidoc.html).
- Using the Visual Scripting Language, which you can extend as well.

The Machinery uses an Entity Component System; therefore, most of your gameplay code will run via Engines or Systems. To learn more about these, please follow this [link](ecs/index.html).



The Engine also offers you a Simulation Entry that can be updated every frame and can offer you a place for ECS independent logic. For more information click [here](gameplay_coding/simulate_entry.html).
