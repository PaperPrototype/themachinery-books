# Creation Graph

In The Machinery, we provide full control over how data enters the engine and what data-processing
steps that get executed, allowing technical artists to better optimize content and setup custom,
game-specific asset pipelines. 

This is handled through *Creation Graphs*. A *Creation Graph* is essentially a generic framework for
processing arbitrary data on the CPUs and GPUs, exposed through a graph front-end view. While we can
use *Creation Graphs* for any type of data processing.

The following section will guide you from basic use cases to more advanced use cases.

We have a couple of blog posts which might also be a valid source of information and interesting to
you.
